# LED-LIGHTS

The attached arduino file uses a threshold value which is used to switch on/off the lights. I noticed that it is different for different sensors and surroundings. So you will have to manually adjust that. The processing code should be running at all times as that is used to generate the color of the LED strip. This is a very basic way of implementing sound sensitive lights but looks very effective when the leds are taped properly.
